# 🚀 zero2hero-ml-journey

Welcome to my personal Machine Learning learning journey!  
This repo documents my progress as I learn and apply concepts from:

- 📘 **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow** by Aurélien Géron  
- 🎓 **A-Z Machine Learning Course** on Udemy by SuperDataScience

---

## 📌 Why this repo?

I've always believed the best way to learn is by doing.  
This repository is my **playground**, **notebook**, and **accountability tracker** as I move from **zero to hero** in ML.

Here, you'll find:
- 🧠 My notes and summaries from each chapter and course section  
- 📓 Jupyter notebooks with practical code and visualizations  
- ✅ My solutions to the exercises and hands-on projects  
- 🗒️ Reflections, ideas, and learnings as I go
